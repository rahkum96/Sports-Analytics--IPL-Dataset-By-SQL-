## Loading dataset to SQL Database:
- There are two method we can upload the data 1) from table wizard 2) from cmd prompt

## Step to follow to import data from cmd prompt:
**1. change directory**
 - cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

**2. mysql -u root -p**
 - enter password- *******

**3. configure with databse and quit the server** 
   - SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
 - quit

**4. configure with clinet server** 
 - mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p

**5. Show Databases;**
 - USE project;

**6. Load the file**
- LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\Users\\Rohit Kumar (Prince)\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Ivy_Data_science\\SQL\\project\\Research_project\\deliveries_all.csv'
INTO TABLE deliveries_all
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;
